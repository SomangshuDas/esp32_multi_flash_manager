Pre-upload validation. Runs a battery of checks across the set of devices

that the UI renders as a report dialog before allowing the upload to
proceed. Nothing here touches hardware — it is a pure, fast, offline
sanity check.

    Validate a list of devices that are about to be flashed together.
    Returns a ValidationReport containing every issue found; the caller
    decides whether ERROR-level issues block the upload (they should).

    `connected_ports` is the set of serial ports currently visible to the
    OS (e.g. from PortWatcher's live scan). If omitted, a fresh scan is
    taken here so this function still works standalone/in tests. Passing
    it in lets the caller flag "port not connected" immediately when
    Upload is clicked, instead of only finding out ~10-30 seconds later
    when esptool's own connect-retry loop finally gives up.

    `monitor_ports` is the set of serial ports that currently have a
    connected Serial Monitor window open (see app/ui/serial_monitor.py).
    esptool cannot open a port that's already held open elsewhere, so any
    device whose port is in this set is flagged as an error telling the
    user to close that Serial Monitor before uploading.

    `supported_chips` is the dynamically-detected chip list from
    app.utilities.chip_detect (queried from the installed esptool at
    startup). If omitted, falls back to the hardcoded SUPPORTED_CHIPS
    constant so this function still works standalone/in tests.

    `dry_run` runs every other check exactly as normal but skips the
    live "is this port currently connected" check -- see ROADMAP.md's
    "Dry-run / pre-flight simulation mode" entry: this lets an operator
    validate a bench configuration (or review a project file someone else
    built) before any hardware is plugged in at all, or even connected to
    this machine. `connected_ports` is ignored when `dry_run` is True
    (every configured port is treated as "would be connected"); every
    other check (duplicate ports, chip/flash-mode/baud validity, firmware
    file presence, address overlaps, security settings, ...) still runs
    exactly as it would for a real upload.
