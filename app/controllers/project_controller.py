project_controller.py
======================
Coordinates project lifecycle: new / open / save / save-as, plus
post-load checks for missing firmware files (never fatal — the project
still loads, offending rows are just flagged so the user can relink
them from the Firmware panel).

Legacy `.efmproj` files (the project's file extension prior to the
switch to `.emfm`) can still be opened for backward compatibility, but
are never silently saved back to their old path/format: opening one
leaves `current_file_path` unset, so the very next Save (Ctrl+S) or
autosave routes to Save As instead of quietly overwriting -- see
`open_project()` and `legacy_project_loaded`.
