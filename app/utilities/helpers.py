    otherwise the same file typed or dropped in with a different
    separator style ends up as two separate entries.

    `os.path.normpath()` collapses separator style and redundant
    segments (mixed `/`/`\\` both become the OS's native separator, and
    `normpath` also folds e.g. `..` where possible); `os.path.normcase()`

    paths -- callers needing that should use `Path.resolve()` instead;
    this function is specifically for the common "cosmetic slash-style
    difference" case, which is what actually happens when the same path
    is typed by hand vs produced by a file picker vs read back from a
    project someone else saved.

    Backslashes are always treated as path separators here, even when
    this process is running on a POSIX system where `os.path` would
    otherwise treat `\\` as a literal filename character. A project file
    referencing a Windows-style path (the overwhelmingly common case for
    an ESP32 flashing bench) needs the same C:/Users/... vs
    C:\\Users\\... equivalence honored consistently regardless of which
    platform this app happens to be running on right now, and a literal
